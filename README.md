# Test-Game-01
A test game using the template app: https://deynum.itch.io/game-dev-the-game. I am choosing to develop with Godot for this project to familiarize myself with the game engine

The initial iteration of this project is to make a robot shooter including a couple artistic requirements.

For a base design of this game I think I will use the "Frozen Frog" as some sort of shopkeep or NPC. The bubblegum gun works well to build in the game as an item so no restrictions there.

|Tower defense game where the enemies are the robots trying to invade the player area.|DrZoidbergPHD|10/14/25|
|A survivors-like would be fun, like you wake up in a post-apocalyptic land with robots sent to destroy all life, your only companion is a frozen frog that wasn't caught because they are completely frozen. Your goal is to help unfreeze your frog friend and run away from the robots. Maybe an escort task when you eventually free frog. The currency could be fuel leaking from the robots to give to the frog to help defrost them. Bubblegum can cause an AoE that slows enemies down.<br><br>Alternatively, you are a robot pretending to be a frog. You shoot down bugs using the bubblegum gun to pretend like you're eating them. You have to balance your robot needs (oiling up, fixing cogs, ect, ect) while preventing too many bugs from showing up making the others suspicious that you're not eating them. Very fast paced and chaotic.|JaxInTheBox|10/16/25|
|Bubblegum gun will definitely cause some slowing affect|AmethystWyrm|10/18/25|
|Maybe I can turn the tower defense into some kind of idle game.|AmethystWyrm|10/21/25|
|Maybe all the wizards accidentally froze themselves trying to complete some spell|JaxInTheBox|10/22/25|
